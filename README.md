# My RL Notes

### MDP
- We use MDP to model states in RL problems
- MP (Markov Process) --> when the nex step only depends on the last state only
- MRP (We add reward to MP)
  When we introduce reward to the MP, a new concept called Gain which is based on return values appears. We will use it later:
